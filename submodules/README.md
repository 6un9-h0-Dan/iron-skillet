# Git Submodules

The playlists and tools use ironskillet-component snippets instead of
sourcing the xml content locally in the iron-skillet repo. Using a submodule
allows for the source content to be updated as needed without changes to the
solution repo.

The submodules can also be used in other solutions that reference the 
IronSkillet configuration elements.
